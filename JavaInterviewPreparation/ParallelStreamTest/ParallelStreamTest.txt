first. Sorting takes at least O(nlogn) time.
We can use a HashSet to add and remove elements. HashSet is implemented by using
25.2 Java Solution
For example, given [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2], the longest consecutive elements sequence
Because it requires O(n) complexity, we can not solve the problem by sorting the array
constant time complexity O(1).
Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements
a hash table. Elements are not ordered. The add, remove and contains methods have
sequence.
Your algorithm should run in O(n) complexity.

should be [1, 2, 3, 4]. Its length is 4.
