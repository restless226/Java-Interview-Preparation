25 Longest Consecutive Sequence
Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements
sequence.
For example, given [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2], the longest consecutive elements sequence
should be [1, 2, 3, 4]. Its length is 4.
Your algorithm should run in O(n) complexity.
25.1 Analysis
Because it requires O(n) complexity, we can not solve the problem by sorting the array
first. Sorting takes at least O(nlogn) time.
25.2 Java Solution
We can use a HashSet to add and remove elements. HashSet is implemented by using
a hash table. Elements are not ordered. The add, remove and contains methods have
constant time complexity O(1).
